          <p>I've been working in Grind Web Studio since March 2022. The new technologies I had experience with were PHP, Laravel, Local, WordPress and especially how BackEnd and FrontEnd have collaboration in the same project.
            Since it is my first job I've learned how people work and how to be part of a team.
